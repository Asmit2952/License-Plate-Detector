# License-Plate-Detector

The License Plate Recognition project uses features detection to recongnize numbers on a license plate image.
The precision achieved is 95%.

This is a simple C++ project made with OpenCV library which is used to detect an object color manually and then draw with that color in real-time on the output screen.

First install OpenCV for Windows by [following these steps](https://dev.to/asmit2952/installing-opencv-on-windows-for-c-326i).
